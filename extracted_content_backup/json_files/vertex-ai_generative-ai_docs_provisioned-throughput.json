Throughput\nmeasurement depends on the model.\nYou want to provide a consistent and predictable experience for users of your\napplications.\nYou want deterministic generative AI costs by paying a fixed monthly or weekly\nprice with control of overages.\nProvisioned Throughput is one of two ways to consume your\ngenerative AI models. The second way is pay-as-you-go, which is also referred to\nas\non-demand\n.\nWhat's next\nSupported models\nusing Provisioned Throughput.\nSend feedback\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n, and code samples are licensed under the\nApache 2.0 License\n.
