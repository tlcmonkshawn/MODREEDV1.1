The following table displays the\nerror message generated by each type of quota framework:\nQuota framework\nMessage\nPay-as-you-go\nResource exhausted, please try again later.\nProvisioned Throughput\nToo many requests. Exceeded the Provisioned Throughput.\nWith a Provisioned Throughput subscription, you can reserve an\namount of throughput for specific generative AI models. If you don't have a\nProvisioned Throughput subscription and resources aren't available\nto your application, then an error code\n429\nis returned. Although you don't\nhave reserved capacity, you can try your request again. However, the request\nisn't counted against your error rate as described in your\nservice level\nagreement (SLA)\n.\nFor projects that have purchased Provisioned Throughput,\nVertex AI measures a project's throughput and reserves the purchased\namount of throughput for the project's actual usage.\nFor standard Provisioned Throughput, when you use less than your\npurchased amount, errors that might otherwise be\n429\nare returned as\n5XX\nand\ncount toward the SLA error rate. For Single Zone Provisioned Throughput,\nwhen you use less than your purchased amount, capacity-related\n429\nerrors are\ntreated as\n5XX\nbut don't count toward the SLA error rate. When you exceed your\npurchased amount, the additional requests are processed on-demand as pay-as-you-go.\nPay-as-you-go\nOn the pay-as-you-go quota framework, you have the following options to\nresolving\n429\nerrors:\nUse the\nglobal endpoint\ninstead of a regional endpoint whenever possible.\nImplement a retry strategy by using\ntruncated exponential backoff\n.\nIf your model uses quotas, you can submit a Quota Increase Request (QIR). If\nyour model uses\nDynamic shared\nquota\n, smoothing traffic\nand reducing large spikes can help. For more information, see\nDynamic shared\nquota (DSQ)\n.\nSubscribe to Provisioned Throughput for a more consistent level of service.\nFor more information, see\nProvisioned Throughput\n.\nProvisioned Throughput\nTo correct the 429 error generated by Provisioned Throughput, do the\nfollowing:\nUse the\nDefault behavior\nexample\n, which doesn't set a\nheader in prediction requests. Any overages are processed on-demand and billed\nas pay-as-you-go.\nIncrease the number of GSUs in your Provisioned Throughput\nsubscription.\nWhat's next\nTo learn more about dynamic shared quota, see\nDynamic shared\nquota\n.\nTo learn more about Provisioned Throughput, see\nProvisioned Throughput\n.\nTo learn about quotas and limits for Vertex AI, see\nVertex AI quotas and limits\n.\nTo learn more about Google Cloud quotas and system limits, see the\nCloud Quotas documentation\n.\nTo learn more about API errors, see\nAPI errors\n.\nSend feedback\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n, and code samples are licensed under the\nApache 2.0 License\n.
