Many can be customized using your own data.\nTo filter models in the filter pane, specify the following:\nTasks\n: Click the task that you want the model to perform.\nModel collections\n: Click to choose models that are managed by Google,\npartners, or you.\nProviders\n: Click the provider of the model.\nFeatures\n: Click the features that you want in the model.\nTo learn more about each model, click its model card.\nFor a list of models available in Model Garden, see\nModels available in Model Garden\n.\nModel security scanning\nGoogle does thorough testing and benchmarking on the serving and tuning\ncontainers that we provide. Active vulnerability scanning is also applied to\ncontainer artifacts.\nThird-party models from featured partners undergo model checkpoint scans to\nensure authenticity. Third-party models from HuggingFace Hub are scanned\ndirectly by HuggingFace and their\nthird-party scanner\nfor malware, pickle files, Keras Lambda layers, and secrets. Models deemed\nunsafe from these scans are flagged by HuggingFace and blocked from deployment\nin Model Garden. Models deemed suspicious or those that have the\nability to potentially execute remote code are indicated in\nModel Garden but can still be deployed. We recommend you perform a\nthorough review of any suspicious model before deploying it\nwithin Model Garden.\nPricing\nFor the open source models in Model Garden, you are charged for use of\nfollowing on Vertex AI:\nModel tuning\n: You are charged for the compute resources used at the same\nrate as custom training. See\ncustom training pricing\n.\nModel deployment\n: You are charged for the compute resources used to\ndeploy the model to an endpoint. See\npredictions pricing\n.\nColab Enterprise\n: See\nColab Enterprise pricing\n.\nControl access to specific models\nYou can set a\nModel Garden organization\npolicy\nat the organization, folder, or\nproject level to control access to specific models in Model Garden. For\nexample, you can allow access to specific models that you've vetted and deny\naccess to all others.\nLearn more about Model Garden\nFor more information about the deployment options and customizations that you\ncan do with models in Model Garden, view the resources in the\nfollowing sections, which include links to tutorials, references, notebooks, and\nYouTube videos.\nDeploy and serve\nLearn more about customizing deployments and advance serving features.\nDeploy and serve open source model using Python SDK, CLI, REST API, or console\nDeveloper blog: Introducing the new Vertex AI Model Garden CLI and SDK\nDeploy open models by using the SDK tutorial notebook\nGet started with Vertex AI Model Garden SDK notebook\nDeploying and fine-tuning Gemma 3 in Model Garden YouTube video\nDeploying Gemma and making predictions\nServe open models with a Hex-LLM container on Cloud\nTPUs\nDeploying Llama models by using Hex-LLM tutorial notebook\nUse prefix caching and speculative decoding with\nHex-LLM or vLLM tutorial notebook\nUse vLLM to serve text-only and multimodel language models on Cloud GPUs\nText-only models tutorial notebook\nMultimodal models tutorial notebook\nUse xDiT GPU serving container for image and video generation\nServing Gemma 2 with multiple LoRA adapters with HuggingFace DLC for PyTorch inference tutorial on Medium\nUse custom handles to serve PaliGemma for image captioning with HuggingFace DLC for PyTorch inference tutorial on LinkedIn\nDeploy and serve a model that uses Spot VMs or a Compute Engine reservation tutorial notebook\nDeploy and serve a HuggingFace model\nContainer compliance\nModel Garden offers the following FedRAMP high compliant\ncontainers for model serving.\nContainer name\nSupported tasks\nContainer image version\nNotebook example\nPyTorch Inference v0.4\naudio2text\ntext2image\nzero-shot-image-classification\nzero-shot-object-detection\ncsm_text2speech\ndia_text2speech\nimage-to-text\nvisual-question-answering\ninstant-id\njanus_text2image\njanus_text_generation\nmask-generation\nnllb_translation\npaligemma_v2\npix2pix\nus-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/vertex-model-garden/pytorch-inference.cu125.0-4.ubuntu2204.py310:model-garden.pytorch-inference-0-4-gpu-release_20251024.01_p0\nHiDream-I1\nSGLang\nText2text generation\nus-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/vertex-model-garden/sglang-serve.cu124.0-4.ubuntu2204.py310:model-garden.sglang-0-4-release_20251031.01_p0\nQwen3 (Deployment)\nHuggingFace Inference Toolkit\ntext2image generation\nvanilla text-generation\ntext-classification\ntranslation\nzero-shot-object-detection\nmask-generation\nsentence embeddings\nfeature extraction\nfill mask\nFull task list:\nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/en/supported_tasks\nus-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/vertex-model-garden/hf-inference-toolkit.cu125.0-1.ubuntu2204.py311:model-garden.hf-inference-toolkit-0-1-release_20251108.00_p0\nHugging Face PyTorch Inference Deployment\nHuggingFace Text Embeddings Inference (TEI)\ntext2embeddings\nus-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/vertex-model-garden/hf-tei.cu125.0-1.ubuntu2204.py310:model-garden.hf-tei-0-1-release_20251030.00_p0\nHugging Face Text Embeddings Inference Deployment\nTuning\nLearn more about tuning models to tailor responses for specific use cases.\nWorkbench fine-tuning tutorial notebook\nFine-tuning and evaluation tutorial notebook\nDeploying and fine-tuning Gemma 3 in Model Garden YouTube video\nEvaluation\nLearn more about assessing model responses with Vertex AI\nEvaluate Gemma 2 with the generative AI evaluation service YouTube video\nAdditional resources\nModel and user journey-specific Model Garden notebooks\nVertex AI open model serving, fine-tuning and evaluation notebooks\nSend feedback\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n, and code samples are licensed under the\nApache 2.0 License\n.
