Gemini 2.5 Flash with Live API native audio features our
cutting-edge native audio functionality for
Live API
. In addition to the
standard Live API features, this preview model includes:
Enhanced audio quality:
Experience dramatically improved audio
quality that feels like speaking with a person.
Enhanced voice quality and adaptability:
Live API
native audio provides richer, more natural voice interactions with
30 HD voices
in
24 languages
.
Introducing
Proactive Audio
:
When Proactive Audio is enabled, the model only responds when it's
relevant. The model generates text transcripts and audio responses
proactively only for queries directed to the device, and does not
respond to non-device directed queries.
Introducing Affective Dialog:
Models using
Live API native audio can understand and respond
appropriately to users' emotional expressions for more nuanced
conversations.
Improved barge-in:
Interrupt Gemini more naturally and
reliably, even in loud and noisy environments.
Robust function calling:
We've improved the triggering rate,
allowing Gemini to successfully execute the functions you
define to support your use cases.
Accurate transcription:
The accuracy of audio-to-text
transcription has been significantly enhanced.
Seamless multilingual support:
Speak to Gemini in
multiple languages, and it will effortlessly switch between them without
any pre-configuration. Language is no longer a barrier.
