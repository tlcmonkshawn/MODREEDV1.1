Dynamic shared quota (DSQ)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Dynamic shared quota (DSQ) was introduced to serve your pay-as-you-go (PayGo)
requests with greater flexibility to adapt to your workload needs without having
to manage quotas and quota increase requests (QIR). With DSQ, there are no predefined
quota limits on your usage. Instead, DSQ provides access to a large, shared pool of
resources, dynamically allocated based on real-time availability of resources and
real-time demand across all customers of that model. When more customers are active,
each customer gets a lower amount of throughput. Similarly, if there are fewer customers,
each customer might get higher throughput.

How DSQ works
Dynamic shared quota (DSQ) adapts to your traffic patterns and needs and
minimizes usage frictions. Your project's access to resources under DSQ is not
capped by an arbitrary number we set. Instead, it's determined by the overall
capacity of the shared pool and the current collective demand from all customers.
This model is designed to offer significant flexibility, allowing your workloads
to burst and consume more resources when available. Conversely, it also allows
all customers of the shared pool to have a chance to access resources when
available without requiring to configure per customer quota.
To ensure a fair and stable experience for all users in the shared resource
environment, Dynamic Shared Quota intelligently manages how requests are handled,
especially during periods of very high demand from isolated sources. Rather than
a fixed cap, DSQ employs a dynamic prioritization approach. This means that while
the system is designed to accommodate bursts, unusually large and rapid spikes in
traffic from a single source may be handled with a different priority than more
consistent, steady traffic. This sophisticated management ensures that broad user
activity and regular workloads are protected from transient, extreme spikes,
promoting overall system stability and equitable access.

Understanding Resource Exhaustion 429 errors under DSQ
We understand that encountering a 'resource exhausted' 429 error can be
frustrating and might lead you to suspect you are hitting some sort of quota
limit. However, with DSQ, this is not the case. These errors indicate that the
overall shared pool of resources for that specific type (e.g., a particular
model in a specific region) at a specific time is experiencing extremely high
demand from many users simultaneously. Think of it like trying to get on a very
popular train during peak rush hour. There isn't a 'ticket limit' specifically
for you, but the train itself might be momentarily full. It's a temporary state
of contention for resources, not a fixed limit imposed on your project.
DSQ is constantly working to manage and distribute the available capacity fairly
and efficiently. When you receive such an error, it means instantaneous demand
has outstripped the available supply in that shared pool. Unlike a hard
quota where you'd be blocked even if resources were idle elsewhere, DSQ aims to
give you access whenever resources are free. The exhaustion error is a reflection
of the entire system's current load, not a ceiling on your account.
We recommend implementing retry mechanisms, as availability in this dynamic
environment can change quickly. For more tactics of handling Resource Exhaustion
errors, see
