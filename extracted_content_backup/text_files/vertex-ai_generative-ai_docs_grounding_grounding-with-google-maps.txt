Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how Grounding with Google Maps with Vertex AI can help to enhance your
generative AI applications by providing geospatial context.
Overview
Grounding with Google Maps with Vertex AI is a service that connects Gemini models with
geospatial data from Google Maps. Google Maps has access to
information on millions of locations, including businesses, landmarks, and
points of interest. This data gives you access to information on over 250
million places that can be used to ground your model's responses, enabling your
AI applications and agents to provide local data and geospatial context.
You can also enable concurrent grounding with Google Maps,
Google Search, and grounding with your data sources.
Uses of Grounding with Google Maps
You can use Grounding with Google Maps for various applications, such as:
Conversational assistants that can answer questions about nearby places, such
as "Where's the nearest place to get an Italian espresso?"
Personalized descriptions and community insights, such as"Can you tell me more about family-friendly restaurants that are within a walkable distance?"
Summaries of areas around specific locations, such as an EV charging station or
a hotel.
This can be beneficial for use cases in real estate, travel, mobility, and
social-media apps.

about different types of places. Grounding with Google Maps uses the
properties to understand your intent and then provides relevant answers based on
the data associated with places in Google Maps.
Plan a family dinner
: You might ask,
Is "The Italian Place" good for
children, and do they offer takeout? What is their rating?
Answers to these
questions help you to determine if a restaurant is suitable for a family and
if the restaurant offers a convenient service.
Check accessibility for a friend
: You might ask,
I need a restaurant that
has a wheelchair accessible entrance.
A response to this prompt might help
you to determine if the location meets specific accessibility needs.
Find a location for a late-night snack
: You might ask,
Is "Burger Joint"
open now? Do they serve dinner? What are their opening hours for Friday?
Answers to these questions help you to find an open establishment serving a
specific meal during a particular time.
Meet a client for coffee
: You might ask,
Does "Cafe Central" have Wifi?
Do they serve coffee? What is their price level, and do they accept credit
cards?
Answers to these questions help you to assess the suitability of a
cafe for a business meeting based on amenities, offerings, and payment
options.
Information in the
Google Maps Grounded Results
might differ from actual
conditions of the road.
Understand your response
Google Maps sources are returned in
groundingMetadata
within
groundingChunks
. Sources are returned for places and for user reviews,
which have been used to help generate the
Google Maps Grounded Result
.
This code sample demonstrates a place source and a place answer source in the
response:

Service usage requirements
This section describes the service usage requirements for Grounding with Google Maps.
Inform the user about the use of Google Maps sources
With each
Google Maps Grounded Result
, you'll receive sources in
groundingChunks
that support each response. The following metadata is also
returned:
source uri
title
ID
When presenting results from Grounding with Google Maps with Vertex AI, you must specify the
associated Google Maps sources, and inform your users of the following:
The Google Maps sources must immediately follow the generated content that
the sources support. This generated content is also referred to as
Google Maps Grounded Result
.
The Google Maps sources must be viewable within one user interaction.
Display Google Maps sources with Google Maps links
For each source in
groundingChunks
and in
grounding_chunks.maps.placeAnswerSources.reviewSnippets
, a link preview must
be generated following these requirements:
Attribute each source to Google Maps following the
Google Maps text
attribution guidelines
.
Display the source title provided in the response.
Link to the source using the
uri
or
googleMapsUri
from the response.
These images show the minimum requirements for displaying the sources and
Google Maps links.
You can collapse the view of the sources.
Optional: Enhance the link preview with additional content, such as:
A
Google Maps favicon
is inserted
before the Google Maps text attribution.
A photo from the source URL (
og:image
).
For more information about some of our Google Maps data providers and their
license terms, see the
Google Maps and Google Earth legal

Context token, place ID, and review ID
The Google Maps data includes context token, place ID, and review ID. You
might cache, store, and export the following response data:
googleMapsWidgetContextToken
placeId
reviewId
The restrictions against caching in the Grounding with Google Maps Terms
don't apply.
Prohibited Territory
Grounding with Google Maps has restrictions for certain content and
activities to maintain a safe and reliable platform. Customer will
not distribute or market a Customer Application that offers
Grounding with Google Maps in a Prohibited Territory. The current Prohibited
Territories are:
China
Crimea
Cuba
Donetsk People's Republic
Iran
Luhansk People's Republic
North Korea
Syria
Vietnam
This list may be updated from time to time.
Optional: Google Maps contextual widget
The contextual widget is a Google Maps Pre-GA Offering that's a visual
container used to support or supplement other Google Maps content. The
Google Maps contextual widget lets you integrate Grounding with Google Maps
into your applications to create a conversational LLM-powered chat experience.
The contextual widget is rendered using the context token,
googleMapsWidgetContextToken
, which is returned in the
Vertex AI API response and can be used to render visual content.
The contextual widget serves different functions depending on your scenario:
It displays user reviews and photos, which is user-generated content (UGC), in
the scenario where Google Maps prompting is used for answer generation.
It helps to enrich results with map visualizations and data when
Vertex AI generates just a text response.
For more information on the contextual widget, see
Maps grounding
widget
.
Render the Google Maps contextual widget
To render and use the Google Maps contextual widget, use the alpha
version of the Google Maps JavaScript API on the page that displays the
widget. For more information, see
Load
the Maps JavaScript API
.
The following code samples demonstrate how to use a contextual widget:
Create a contextual widget.
<body>
<gmp-place-contextual id="widget"></gmp-place-contextual>
</body>
In any response that is grounded with Google Maps, there's a
corresponding
googleMapsWidgetContextToken
that's used to render the
contextual widget and placed in close proximity to the generated response.
To update the context token, set the
widget.contextToken property
.
"googleMapsWidgetContextToken"
:
"widgetcontent/AcBXPQdpWQWbap9H-OH8sEKmOXxmEKAYvff0tvthhneMQC3VrqWCjpnPBl4-Id98FGiA_S_t8aeAeJj0T6JkWFX56Bil8oBSR0W8JH3C_RSYLbTjxKdpxc9yNn6JcZTtolIRZon9xi6WpNGuSyjcIxWu2S0hwpasNOpUlWrG1RxVCB4WD1fsz_pwR236mG36lMxevXTQ_JnfdYNuQwQ4Lc3vn...<snip>...
