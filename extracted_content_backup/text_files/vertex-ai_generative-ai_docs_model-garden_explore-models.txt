Overview of Model Garden
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Model Garden is an AI/ML model library that helps you discover, test,
customize, and deploy models and assets from Google and Google partners.
Advantages of Model Garden
When you're working with AI models, Model Garden provides the following
advantages:
Available models are all grouped in a single location
Model Garden provides a consistent deployment pattern for different
types of models
Model Garden provides built-in integration with other parts of
Vertex AI such as model tuning, evaluation, and serving
Serving generative AI models can be difficult—Vertex AI handles
model deployment and serving for you
Explore models
To view the list of available Vertex AI and open source foundation,
tunable, and task-specific models, go to the Model Garden page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to Model Garden
The model categories available in Model Garden are:
Category
Description
Foundation models
Pretrained multitask large models that can be tuned or customized
for specific tasks using Vertex AI Studio, Vertex AI API, and the
Vertex AI SDK for Python.
Fine-tunable models
Models that you can fine-tune using a custom notebook or
pipeline.
Task-specific solutions
Most of these prebuilt models are
ready to use. Many can be customized using your own data.
To filter models in the filter pane, specify the following:
Tasks
: Click the task that you want the model to perform.
Model collections
: Click to choose models that are managed by Google,
partners, or you.
Providers
: Click the provider of the model.
Features
: Click the features that you want in the model.
To learn more about each model, click its model card.
For a list of models available in Model Garden, see
Models available in Model Garden
.
Model security scanning
Google does thorough testing and benchmarking on the serving and tuning
containers that we provide. Active vulnerability scanning is also applied to
container artifacts.
Third-party models from featured partners undergo model checkpoint scans to
ensure authenticity. Third-party models from HuggingFace Hub are scanned
directly by HuggingFace and their
third-party scanner
for malware, pickle files, Keras Lambda layers, and secrets. Models deemed
unsafe from these scans are flagged by HuggingFace and blocked from deployment
in Model Garden. Models deemed suspicious or those that have the
ability to potentially execute remote code are indicated in
Model Garden but can still be deployed. We recommend you perform a
thorough review of any suspicious model before deploying it
within Model Garden.
Pricing
For the open source models in Model Garden, you are charged for use of
following on Vertex AI:
Model tuning
: You are charged for the compute resources used at the same
rate as custom training. See
custom training pricing
.
Model deployment
: You are charged for the compute resources used to
deploy the model to an endpoint. See
predictions pricing
.
Colab Enterprise
: See
Colab Enterprise pricing
.
Control access to specific models
You can set a
Model Garden organization
policy
at the organization, folder, or
project level to control access to specific models in Model Garden. For
example, you can allow access to specific models that you've vetted and deny
access to all others.
