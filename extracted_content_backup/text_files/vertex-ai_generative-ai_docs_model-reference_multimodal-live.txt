The Live API enables low-latency bidirectional voice and video
interactions with Gemini. Using the Live API, you can
provide end users with the experience of natural, human-like voice
conversations, and with the ability to interrupt the model's responses using
voice commands. The Live API
can process text, audio, and video input, and it can provide text and audio
output.
For more information about the Live API, see
Live API
.
Capabilities
Live API includes the following key capabilities:
Multimodality
: The model can see, hear, and speak.
Low-latency realtime interaction
: The model can provide fast responses.
Session memory
: The model retains memory of all interactions
within a single session, recalling previously heard or seen information.
Support for function calling, code execution, and Search as a Tool
:
You can integrate the model with external services and data sources.
Live API is designed for server-to-server communication.
For web and mobile apps, we recommend using the integration from our partners
at
Daily
.

Integration guide
This section describes how integration works with Live API.
Sessions
A WebSocket connection establishes a session between the client and the
Gemini server.
After a client initiates a new connection the session can exchange messages
with the server to:
Send text, audio, or video to the Gemini server.
Receive audio, text, or function call requests from the
Gemini server.
The session configuration is sent in the first message after connection.
A session configuration includes the model, generation parameters,
system instructions, and tools.
See the following example configuration:
{
"model": string,
"generationConfig": {
"candidateCount": integer,
"maxOutputTokens": integer,
"temperature": number,
"topP": number,
"topK": integer,
"presencePenalty": number,
"frequencyPenalty": number,
"responseModalities": [string],
"speechConfig": object
},
"systemInstruction": string,
"tools": [object]
}
For more information, see
BidiGenerateContentSetup
.
Send messages
Messages are JSON-formatted objects exchanged over the WebSocket connection.
To send a message the client must send a JSON object over an open WebSocket
connection. The JSON object must have
exactly one
of the fields from the
following object set:
{
"setup": BidiGenerateContentSetup,
"clientContent": BidiGenerateContentClientContent,
"realtimeInput": BidiGenerateContentRealtimeInput,
"toolResponse": BidiGenerateContentToolResponse
}
Supported client messages
See the supported client messages in the following table:
Message
Description
BidiGenerateContentSetup
Session configuration to be sent in the first message
BidiGenerateContentClientContent
Incremental content update of the current conversation delivered from the client
BidiGenerateContentRealtimeInput
Real time audio or video input
BidiGenerateContentToolResponse
Response to a
ToolCallMessage
received from the server
Receive messages
To receive messages from Gemini, listen for the WebSocket
'message' event, and then parse the result according to the definition of the
supported server messages.
See the following:
ws
.
addEventListener
(
"message"
,
async
(
evt
)
=>
{
if
(
evt
.
data
instanceof
Blob
)

Process
the
received
data
(
audio
,
video
,
etc
.
)
}
else
{
//
Process
JSON
response
}
});
Server messages will have
exactly one
of the fields from the following object
set:
{
"setupComplete": BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete,
"serverContent": BidiGenerateContentServerContent,
"toolCall": BidiGenerateContentToolCall,
"toolCallCancellation": BidiGenerateContentToolCallCancellation
"usageMetadata": UsageMetadata
"goAway": GoAway
"sessionResumptionUpdate": SessionResumptionUpdate
"inputTranscription": BidiGenerateContentTranscription
"outputTranscription": BidiGenerateContentTranscription
}
Supported server messages
See the supported server messages in the following table:
Message
Description
BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete
A
BidiGenerateContentSetup
message from the client, sent when setup is complete
BidiGenerateContentServerContent
Content generated by the model in response to a client message
BidiGenerateContentToolCall
Request for the client to run the function calls and return the responses with the matching IDs
BidiGenerateContentToolCallCancellation
Sent when a function call is canceled due to the user interrupting model output
UsageMetadata
A report of the number of tokens used by the session so far
GoAway
A signal that the current connection will soon be terminated
SessionResumptionUpdate
A session checkpoint, which can be resumed
BidiGenerateContentTranscription
A transcription of either the user's or model's speech
Incremental content updates
Use incremental updates to send text input, establish session context, or
restore session context. For short contexts you can send turn-by-turn
interactions to represent the exact sequence of events. For longer contexts
it's recommended to provide a single message summary to free up the
context window for the follow up interactions.
See the following example context message:
{
"clientContent"
:
{
"turns"
:
[
{
"parts"
:[
{
"text"
:
""
}
],
"role"
:
"user"
},
{
"parts"
:[
{
"text"
:
""
}
],
"role"
:
"model"
}
],
"turnComplete"
:
true
}
}
Note that while content parts can be of a
functionResponse
type,
BidiGenerateContentClientContent
shouldn't be used to provide a response
to the function calls issued by the model.
BidiGenerateContentToolResponse
should be used instead.
BidiGenerateContentClientContent
should only be
used to establish previous context or provide text input to the conversation.
Streaming audio and video
Code execution
To learn more about code execution, see
Code execution
.
Function calling
All functions must be declared at the start of the session by sending tool
definitions as part of the
BidiGenerateContentSetup
message.
You define functions by using JSON, specifically with a
select subset
of the
OpenAPI schema format
.
A single function declaration can include the following parameters:
name
(string): The unique identifier for the function
within the API call.
description
(string): A comprehensive explanation
of the function's purpose and capabilities.
parameters
(object): Defines the input data required
by the function.
type
(string): Specifies the overall data type,
such as object.
properties
(object): Lists individual parameters,
each with:
type
(string): The data type of the parameter,
such as string, integer, boolean.
description
(string): A clear explanation of
the parameter's purpose and expected format.
required
(array): An array of strings listing
the parameter names that are mandatory for the function to operate.
For code examples of a function declaration using curl commands, see
Function calling with the Gemini
API
.
For examples of how to create function declarations using the
Gemini API SDKs, see the
Function calling
tutorial
.
From a single prompt, the model can generate multiple function calls and the
code necessary to chain their outputs. This code executes in a
sandbox environment, generating subsequent
BidiGenerateContentToolCall
messages. The execution pauses until the results of each function call
are available, which ensures sequential processing.
The client should respond with
BidiGenerateContentToolResponse
.
To learn more, see
Introduction to function calling
.
Audio formats
See the list of
supported audio formats
.
System instructions
You can provide system instructions to better control the model's output
and specify the tone and sentiment of audio responses.
System instructions are added to the prompt before the interaction begins
and remain in effect for the entire session.
System instructions can only be set at the beginning of a session,
immediately following the initial connection. To provide further input
to the model during the session, use incremental content updates.
Interruptions
Users can interrupt the model's output at any time. When
Voice activity detection (VAD) detects an interruption, the ongoing
generation is canceled and discarded. Only the information already sent
to the client is retained in the session history. The server then
sends a
BidiGenerateContentServerContent
message to report the interruption.
In addition, the Gemini server discards any pending
function calls and sends a
BidiGenerateContentServerContent
message with the
IDs of the canceled calls.
Voices
To specify a voice, set the
voiceName
within the
speechConfig
object,
as part of your
session configuration
.
See the following JSON representation of a
speechConfig
object:
{
"voiceConfig"
:
{
"prebuiltVoiceConfig"
:
{
"voiceName"
:
"
VOICE_NAME
"
}
}
}
To see the list of supported voices, see
Change voice and language settings
.
Limitations
Consider the following limitations of Live API and
Gemini 2.0 when you plan your project.
Client authentication
Live API only provides server to server authentication
and isn't recommended for direct client use. Client input should be routed
through an intermediate application server for secure authentication with
the Live API.
Maximum session duration
The default maximum length of a conversation session is 10 minutes. For
more information, see
Session length
.
Video frame rate
When you stream video to the model, it is processed at 1 frame per second (FPS). This makes the API unsuitable for use cases that require analyzing fast-changing video, such as play-by-play in high-speed sports.
Voice activity detection (VAD)
By default, the model automatically performs voice activity detection (VAD) on
a continuous audio input stream. VAD can be configured with the
RealtimeInputConfig.AutomaticActivityDetection
field of the
setup message
.
When the audio stream is paused for more than a second (for example,
when the user switches off the microphone), an
AudioStreamEnd
event is sent to flush any cached audio. The client can resume sending
audio data at any time.
Alternatively, the automatic VAD can be turned off by setting
RealtimeInputConfig.AutomaticActivityDetection.disabled
to
true
in the setup
message. In this configuration the client is responsible for detecting user
speech and sending
ActivityStart
and
ActivityEnd
messages at the appropriate times. An
AudioStreamEnd
isn't sent in
this configuration. Instead, any interruption of the stream is marked by
an
ActivityEnd
message.
Additional limitations
Manual endpointing isn't supported.
Audio inputs and audio outputs negatively impact the model's ability to
use function calling.
Token count
Token count isn't supported.
Rate limits
The following rate limits apply:
5,000 concurrent sessions per project
4M tokens per minute
Messages and events
BidiGenerateContentClientContent
Incremental update of the current conversation delivered from the client. All the content here is unconditionally appended to the conversation history and used as part of the prompt to the model to generate content.
A message here will interrupt any current model generation.
Fields
turns[]
Content
Optional. The content appended to the current conversation with the model.
For single-turn queries, this is a single instance. For multi-turn queries, this is a repeated field that contains conversation history and latest request.
turn_complete
bool
Optional. If true, indicates that the server content generation should start with the currently accumulated prompt. Otherwise, the server will await additional messages before starting generation.
BidiGenerateContentRealtimeInput
User input that is sent in real time.
This is different from
ClientContentUpdate
in a few ways:
Can be sent continuously without interruption to model generation.
If there is a need to mix data interleaved across the
ClientContentUpdate
and the
RealtimeUpdate
, server attempts to  optimize for best response, but there are no guarantees.
End of turn is not explicitly specified, but is rather derived from user  activity (for example, end of speech).
Even before the end of turn, the data is processed incrementally  to optimize for a fast start of the response from the model.
Is always assumed to be the user's input (cannot be used to populate  conversation history).
Fields
media_chunks[]
Blob
Optional. Inlined bytes data for media input.
activity_start
ActivityStart
Optional. Marks the start of user activity. This can only be sent if automatic (i.e. server-side) activity detection is disabled.
activity_end
ActivityEnd
Optional. Marks the end of user activity. This can only be sent if automatic (i.e. server-side) activity detection is disabled.
ActivityEnd
This type has no fields.
Marks the end of user activity.
ActivityStart
This type has no fields.
Only one of the fields in this message must be set at a time. Marks the start of user activity.
BidiGenerateContentServerContent
Incremental server update generated by the model in response to client messages.
Content is generated as quickly as possible, and not in realtime. Clients may choose to buffer and play it out in realtime.
Fields
turn_complete
bool
Output only. If true, indicates that the model is done generating. Generation will only start in response to additional client messages. Can be set alongside
content
, indicating that the
content
is the last in the turn.
interrupted
bool
Output only. If true, indicates that a client message has interrupted current model generation. If the client is playing out the content in realtime, this is a good signal to stop and empty the current queue. If the client is playing out the content in realtime, this is a good signal to stop and empty the current playback queue.
generation_complete
bool
Output only. If true, indicates that the model is done generating.
When model is interrupted while generating there will be no 'generation_complete' message in interrupted turn, it will go through 'interrupted > turn_complete'.
When model assumes realtime playback there will be delay between generation_complete and turn_complete that is caused by model waiting for playback to finish.
grounding_metadata
GroundingMetadata
Output only. Metadata specifies sources used to ground generated content.
input_transcription
Transcription
Optional. Input transcription. The transcription is independent to the model turn which means it doesn't imply any ordering between transcription and model turn.
output_transcription
Transcription
Optional. Output transcription. The transcription is independent to the model turn which means it doesn't imply any ordering between transcription and model turn.
model_turn
Content
Output only. The content that the model has generated as part of the current conversation with the user.
Transcription
Audio transcription message.
Fields
text
string
Optional. Transcription text.
finished
bool
Optional. The bool indicates the end of the transcription.
BidiGenerateContentSetup
Message to be sent in the first and only first client message. Contains configuration that will apply for the duration of the streaming session.
Clients should wait for a
BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete
message before sending any additional messages.
Fields
model
string
Required. The fully qualified name of the publisher model.
Publisher model format:
projects/{project}/locations/{location}/publishers/\*/models/\*
generation_config
GenerationConfig
Optional. Generation config.
The following fields aren't supported:
response_logprobs
response_mime_type
logprobs
response_schema
stop_sequence
routing_config
audio_timestamp
system_instruction
Content
Optional. The user provided system instructions for the model. Note: only text should be used in parts and content in each part will be in a separate paragraph.
tools[]
Tool
Optional. A list of
Tools
the model may use to generate the next response.
A
Tool
is a piece of code that enables the system to interact with external systems to perform an action, or set of actions, outside of knowledge and scope of the model.
session_resumption
SessionResumptionConfig
Optional. Configures session resumption mechanism. If included, the server will send periodical
SessionResumptionUpdate
messages to the client.
context_window_compression
ContextWindowCompressionConfig
Optional. Configures context window compression mechanism.
If included, server will compress context window to fit into given length.
realtime_input_config
RealtimeInputConfig
Optional. Configures the handling of realtime input.
input_audio_transcription
AudioTranscriptionConfig
Optional. The transcription of the input aligns with the input audio language.
output_audio_transcription
AudioTranscriptionConfig
Optional. The transcription of the output aligns with the language code specified for the output audio.
AudioTranscriptionConfig
This type has no fields.
The audio transcription configuration.
BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete
Sent in response to a
BidiGenerateContentSetup
message from the client.
Fields
session_id
string
The session id of the session.
BidiGenerateContentToolCall
Request for the client to execute the
function_calls
and return the responses with the matching
id
s.
Fields
function_calls[]
FunctionCall
Output only. The function call to be executed.
BidiGenerateContentToolCallCancellation
Notification for the client that a previously issued
ToolCallMessage
with the specified
id
s should have been not executed and should be cancelled. If there were side-effects to those tool calls, clients may attempt to undo the tool calls. This message occurs only in cases where the clients interrupt server turns.
Fields
ids[]
string
Output only. The ids of the tool calls to be cancelled.
BidiGenerateContentToolResponse
Client generated response to a
ToolCall
received from the server. Individual
FunctionResponse
objects are matched to the respective
FunctionCall
objects by the
id
field.
Note that in the unary and server-streaming GenerateContent APIs function calling happens by exchanging the
Content
parts, while in the bidi GenerateContent APIs function calling happens over these dedicated set of messages.
Fields
function_responses[]
FunctionResponse
Optional. The response to the function calls.
RealtimeInputConfig
Configures the realtime input behavior in
BidiGenerateContent
.
Fields
automatic_activity_detection
AutomaticActivityDetection
Optional. If not set, automatic activity detection is enabled by default. If automatic voice detection is disabled, the client must send activity signals.
activity_handling
ActivityHandling
Optional. Defines what effect activity has.
turn_coverage
TurnCoverage
Optional. Defines which input is included in the user's turn.
ActivityHandling
The different ways of handling user activity.
Enums
ACTIVITY_HANDLING_UNSPECIFIED
If unspecified, the default behavior is
START_OF_ACTIVITY_INTERRUPTS
.
START_OF_ACTIVITY_INTERRUPTS
If true, start of activity will interrupt the model's response (also called "barge in"). The model's current response will be cut-off in the moment of the interruption. This is the default behavior.
NO_INTERRUPTION
The model's response will not be interrupted.
AutomaticActivityDetection
Configures automatic detection of activity.
Fields
start_of_speech_sensitivity
StartSensitivity
Optional. Determines how likely speech is to be detected.
end_of_speech_sensitivity
EndSensitivity
Optional. Determines how likely detected speech is ended.
prefix_padding_ms
int32
Optional. The required duration of detected speech before start-of-speech is committed. The lower this value the more sensitive the start-of-speech detection is and the shorter speech can be recognized. However, this also increases the probability of false positives.
silence_duration_ms
int32
Optional. The required duration of detected silence (or non-speech) before end-of-speech is committed. The larger this value, the longer speech gaps can be without interrupting the user's activity but this will increase the model's latency.
disabled
bool
Optional. If enabled, detected voice and text input count as activity. If disabled, the client must send activity signals.
EndSensitivity
End of speech sensitivity.
Enums
END_SENSITIVITY_UNSPECIFIED
The default is END_SENSITIVITY_LOW.
END_SENSITIVITY_HIGH
Automatic detection ends speech more often.
END_SENSITIVITY_LOW
Automatic detection ends speech less often.
StartSensitivity
Start of speech sensitivity.
Enums
START_SENSITIVITY_UNSPECIFIED
The default is START_SENSITIVITY_LOW.
START_SENSITIVITY_HIGH
Automatic detection will detect the start of speech more often.
START_SENSITIVITY_LOW
Automatic detection will detect the start of speech less often.
TurnCoverage
Options about which input is included in the user's turn.
Enums
TURN_COVERAGE_UNSPECIFIED
If unspecified, the default behavior is
TURN_INCLUDES_ALL_INPUT
.
TURN_INCLUDES_ONLY_ACTIVITY
The users turn only includes activity since the last turn, excluding inactivity (e.g. silence on the audio stream).
TURN_INCLUDES_ALL_INPUT
The users turn includes all realtime input since the last turn, including inactivity (e.g. silence on the audio stream). This is the default behavior.
UsageMetadata
Metadata on the usage of the cached content.
Fields
total_token_count
int32
Total number of tokens that the cached content consumes.
text_count
int32
Number of text characters.
image_count
int32
Number of images.
video_duration_seconds
int32
Duration of video in seconds.
audio_duration_seconds
int32
Duration of audio in seconds.
GoAway
Server will not be able to service client soon.
Fields
time_left
Duration
The remaining time before the connection will be terminated as ABORTED. The minimal time returned here is specified differently together with the rate limits for a given model.
SessionResumptionUpdate
Update of the session resumption state.
Only sent if
BidiGenerateContentSetup.session_resumption
was set.
Fields
new_handle
string
New handle that represents state that can be resumed. Empty if
resumable
=false.
resumable
bool
True if session can be resumed at this point.
It might be not possible to resume session at some points. In that case we send update empty new_handle and resumable=false. Example of such case could be model executing function calls or just generating. Resuming session (using previous session token) in such state will result in some data loss.
last_consumed_client_message_index
int64
Index of last message sent by client that is included in state represented by this SessionResumptionToken. Only sent when
SessionResumptionConfig.transparent
is set.
Presence of this index allows users to transparently reconnect and avoid issue of losing some part of realtime audio input/video. If client wishes to temporarily disconnect (for example as result of receiving GoAway) they can do it without losing state by buffering messages sent since last
SessionResmumptionTokenUpdate
. This field will enable them to limit buffering (avoid keeping all requests in RAM).
It will not be used for 'resumption to restore state' some time later -- in those cases partial audio and video frames are likely not needed.
