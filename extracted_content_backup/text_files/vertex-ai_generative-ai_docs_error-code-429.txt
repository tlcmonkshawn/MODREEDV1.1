Error code 429
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If the number of your requests exceeds the capacity allocated to process
requests, then error code
429
is returned. The following table displays the
error message generated by each type of quota framework:
Quota framework
Message
Pay-as-you-go
Resource exhausted, please try again later.
Provisioned Throughput
Too many requests. Exceeded the Provisioned Throughput.
With a Provisioned Throughput subscription, you can reserve an
amount of throughput for specific generative AI models. If you don't have a
Provisioned Throughput subscription and resources aren't available
to your application, then an error code
429
is returned. Although you don't
have reserved capacity, you can try your request again. However, the request
isn't counted against your error rate as described in your
service level
agreement (SLA)
.
For projects that have purchased Provisioned Throughput,
Vertex AI measures a project's throughput and reserves the purchased
amount of throughput for the project's actual usage.
For standard Provisioned Throughput, when you use less than your
purchased amount, errors that might otherwise be
429
are returned as
5XX
and
count toward the SLA error rate. For Single Zone Provisioned Throughput,
when you use less than your purchased amount, capacity-related
429
errors are
treated as
5XX
but don't count toward the SLA error rate. When you exceed your
purchased amount, the additional requests are processed on-demand as pay-as-you-go.
Pay-as-you-go
On the pay-as-you-go quota framework, you have the following options to
resolving
429
errors:
Use the
global endpoint
instead of a regional endpoint whenever possible.
Implement a retry strategy by using
truncated exponential backoff
.
If your model uses quotas, you can submit a Quota Increase Request (QIR). If
your model uses
Dynamic shared
quota
, smoothing traffic
and reducing large spikes can help. For more information, see
Dynamic shared
quota (DSQ)
.
Subscribe to Provisioned Throughput for a more consistent level of service.

Provisioned Throughput
To correct the 429 error generated by Provisioned Throughput, do the
following:
Use the
Default behavior
example
, which doesn't set a
header in prediction requests. Any overages are processed on-demand and billed
as pay-as-you-go.
Increase the number of GSUs in your Provisioned Throughput
subscription.
