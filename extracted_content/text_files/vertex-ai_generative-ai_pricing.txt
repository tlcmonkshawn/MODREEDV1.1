LiveAPI Session's Context Window billing explained
: You are charged per turn for all tokens present in the Session Context Window. The Session Context Window includes new tokens (current turn) + all accumulated tokens from previous turns. This means tokens from past turns are re-processed and accounted for in each new turn, up to your configured context window size. A "turn" is one user input and the model's response.
Proactive Audio Mode
: When enabled, input tokens are charged while LiveAPI is listening. Output tokens are only charged when the API responds.
When audio to text transcription is enabled, all text tokens generated for transcription are charged at the text token output rate.
Gemini 2.0
Gemini 2.0 is billed based on tokens. To calculate the number of input tokens in
your request prior to sending the request, you can use the
SDK
tokenizer
or the
countTokens API
.
If your request fails with a 400 or 500 error, you won't be charged for the
tokens used.
Use the toggle in the pricing table to compare token-based pricing and
modality-based pricing.

Vertex AI Model Optimizer Pricing  (Experimental)*
Vertex AI Model Optimizer simplifies use of Gemini for enterprise customers by providing a single meta-endpoint for Gemini model requests--customers using this service do not have to specify whether to use Flash, Pro, or a specific version. Instead they simply provide a configurable setting (cost, quality, or balance) to indicate their preferences, and Model Optimizer applies the right level of intelligence appropriate for the task by sending each query to the best fit model.
Vertex AI Model Optimizer applies dynamic pricing. This means that the average price per token is dependent on the model intelligence level applied to complete the task. For this reason, pricing examples are provided below to illustrate likely scenarios based on your configuration setting (see tables below). Model Optimizer SKUs are $1 skus that function as a purchasing unit to apply for your billing, you are still billed on a consumption basis after you have used the models.

Other Gemini models
All Gemini models other than Gemini 2.0 or Gemini 2.5 are billed based on modalities such as
characters, images, video/audio seconds. Text input is charged by every 1,000
characters of input (prompt) and every 1,000 characters of output (response).
Characters are counted by UTF-8 code points and white space is excluded from the
count, resulting in approximately 4 characters per token. Prediction requests
that lead to filtered responses are charged for the input only. At the end of
each billing cycle, fractions of one cent ($0.01) are rounded to one cent. Media
input is charged per image or per second (video). If your request fails with a
400 or 500 error, you won't be charged for the tokens used.

Modality-based pricing
The below modality pricing is based on average use cases for reference only. Actual billing will only be based on tokens:
4 characters result in approximately 1 text token including white space.
For an 1024x1024 image, it consumes 1290 tokens. Per image token count varies by image resolution. For more information on how to calculate tokens, you can refer to our
documentation
.
Video input consumes 258 tokens per second at the sample rate of one frame per second. Video with audio bills for both video tokens and audio tokens.
Audio input consumes 25 tokens per second without timestamp.

Example cost calculation
A user needs to ensure they can support 10 queries per second (QPS) of a query with input of 1,000 text tokens and 500 audio tokens and receive an output of 300 text tokens using gemini-2.0-flash.
Using the throughput and burndown rate
table
,
for gemini-2.0-flash we know an input text token's burndown rate is 1 token, an
input audio token's burndown rate is 7 tokens, and an output text token's burndown rate is 4 tokens.
The user's total input tokens is 1,000* (1 token per input text token) + 500* (7 tokens per input audio token) =  4,500 burndown adjusted input tokens. The user's total output tokens is 300* (4 tokens per output text token) = 1,200 burndown adjusted output tokens. Adding them together gives us 4,500 burndown adjusted input tokens + 1,200 burndown adjusted output tokens = 5,700 total tokens per query.
Multiplying the total tokens per query by QPS gives us 5,700 total tokens per query * 10 QPS = 57,000 total tokens per second.
Dividing this by the total throughput per second per GSU gives us 57,000 total tokens per second ÷ 3,360 per-second throughput per GSU = 16.96 GSUs. The minimum GSU purchase increment for this model is 1, so the user would need 17 GSUs.
If the user wanted to sustain this throughput for 1 week, it would cost $1,200 * 17 GSUs = $20,400 per week. If they wanted to sustain this throughput for 1 month, it would cost $2,700 * 17 GSUs = $45,900 per month. If they wanted to sustain this throughput for 3 months, it would cost $2,400 * 17 GSUs = $40,800 per month. And finally, if they wanted to sustain this throughput for 1 year, it would cost $2,000 * 17 GSUs = $34,000 per month.
Model Tuning
Model tuning is an effective way to customize large models to your tasks. It's a key step to improve the model's quality and efficiency. Model tuning provides the following benefits:
Higher quality for your specific tasks
Increased model robustness
Lower inference latency and cost due to shorter prompts
Tuning is charged per million training tokens. Training tokens are calculated by the total number of tokens in your training dataset, multiplied by your number of epochs. For model inference, Gemini tuned model endpoint has the same prediction price as the base model.
