Using Proactive Audio
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Proactive Audio helps Gemini have more authentic
conversations by letting you control when it responds and in what contexts with
fewer interruptions. For example, you can ask Gemini to only respond
when prompted or when certain specific topics are discussed. To see
Proactive Audio in action, check out
a demonstration of the features
.
This guide covers how Proactive Audio works, how to
integrate it into your application, and what tokens you are billed for. This
guide doesn't cover the price list for Proactive Audio. For
full pricing details, see
Vertex AI pricing
.
This guide assumes you are working either in Vertex AI Studio or are
using the Google Gen AI SDK for Python.

ProactivityConfig
(
proactive_audio

Have a conversation using Proactive Audio
You can initiate a conversation with Gemini using
Proactive Audio and define when Gemini can
respond, limiting its responses to relevant topics.
For example, the following is a sample of what a conversation with
Gemini about cooking might look like:
Prompt: "You are an AI assistant in Italian cooking; only chime in when the topic is about Italian cooking."
Speaker A: "I really love cooking!" (No response from Gemini.)
Speaker B: "Oh yes, me too! My favorite is French cuisine." (No response from
Gemini.)
Speaker A: "I really like Italian food; do you know how to make a pizza?"
(Italian cooking topic will trigger response from Gemini.)
Live API: "I'd be happy to help! Here's a recipe for a pizza."
Features
When using Proactive Audio, Gemini will respond with
minimal latency after the user is done speaking. This reduces interruptions and
helps Gemini not lose context if an interruption happens.
Proactive Audio also helps Gemini avoid interruptions
from background noise or external chatter, and prevents Gemini from
responding if external chatter is introduced during a conversation.
If the user needs to interrupt during a response from Gemini,
Proactive Audio makes it easier for Gemini to
appropriately back-channel (meaning appropriate interruptions are handled),
rather than if a user uses filler words such as
umm
or
uhh
.
Gemini can co-listen to an audio file that's not the speaker's
voice and subsequently answer questions about that audio file later in the
conversation.
Billing
While Gemini is listening to a conversation, input audio tokens will be
charged.
For output audio tokens, you're only charged when Gemini responds. If
Gemini does not respond or stays silent, there will be no charge to
your output audio tokens.
