This page explains what Provisioned Throughput is and when to use Provisioned Throughput.
Introduction to Provisioned Throughput
Provisioned Throughput is a fixed-cost, fixed-term subscription
available in several term-lengths that reserves throughput for
supported generative AI models
on Vertex AI.
To reserve your throughput, you must specify the model and
available
locations
in which the model
runs.
When to use Provisioned Throughput
If any of the following considerations apply to your use case, consider using
Provisioned Throughput:
You are building real-time generative AI production applications, such as
chatbots and agents.
Your critical workloads consistently require high throughput. Throughput
measurement depends on the model.
You want to provide a consistent and predictable experience for users of your
applications.
You want deterministic generative AI costs by paying a fixed monthly or weekly
price with control of overages.
Provisioned Throughput is one of two ways to consume your
generative AI models. The second way is pay-as-you-go, which is also referred to
as
on-demand
.
