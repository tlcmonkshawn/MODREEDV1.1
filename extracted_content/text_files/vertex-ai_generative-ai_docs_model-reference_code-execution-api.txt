Execute code with the Gemini API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Gemini API code execution feature enables the model to generate and run
Python code and learn iteratively from the results until it arrives at a final
output. You can use this code execution capability to build applications that
benefit from code-based reasoning and that produce text output. For example,
you could use code execution in an application that solves equations or
processes text.
The Gemini API provides code execution as a tool, similar to
function calling
. After
you add code execution as a tool, the model decides when to use it.
Supported models
Gemini 2.5 Flash
(Preview)
Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite
(Preview)
Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite
Gemini 2.0 Flash with Live API
(Preview)
Gemini 2.5 Pro
Gemini 2.5 Flash
Gemini 2.0 Flash
Limitations
The feature doesn't support file I/O.
Code execution can run for a maximum of 30 seconds before timing out.
Example syntax
curl

=

Parameter list
See
examples
for implementation details.
Python
To enable code execution, specify a code execution
tool
in your request.
CodeExecution
Tool that executes code generated by the model, and automatically returns the result to the model. See also
ExecutableCode
and
CodeExecutionResult
which are input and output to this tool.
Part
executable_code
Optional:
ExecutableCode
Code generated by the model that is meant to be executed.
See Code Execution [API].
code_execution_result
Optional:
CodeExecutionResult
Result of executing the [ExecutableCode].
See Code Execution [API].
ExecutableCode
language
Required:
string (enum)
Supported programming languages for the generated
code
.
Supported:
PYTHON
code
Required:
string
The code to be executed.
See Code Execution [API].
CodeExecutionResult
outcome
Required:
string (enum)
Outcome of the code execution.
Possible outcomes:
Code execution completed successfully. (
OUTCOME_OK
)
Code execution finished but with a failure.
stderr
should contain the reason. (
OUTCOME_FAILED
)
Code execution ran for too long, and was cancelled. There may or may not be a partial output present. (
OUTCOME_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
)
output
Required:
string
Contains
stdout
when code execution is successful,
stderr
or other description otherwise.
See Code Execution [API].
Examples
Here are illustrations of how you can submit a query and function declarations to the model.
