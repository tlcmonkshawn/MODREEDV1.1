Install a library
The following examples can help you get started in various programming languages.
Python
You can install our
Python library
by running:
pip
install
google-genai
Go
You can install our
Go library
by running:
go
get
google.golang.org/genai
JavaScript and TypeScript
You can install our
JavaScript and TypeScript library
by running:
npm
install
@google/genai
The
new
JavaScript and TypeScript library is available in
preview
, which means
it may not be feature complete and that we may need to introduce breaking changes.
However, we
highly recommend
you start using the
new SDK
over the previous, deprecated version as long as you're comfortable with these caveats.
We're actively working towards a GA (General Availability) release for this library.
Java

Java library
by adding the dependencies in Maven:
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.genai</groupId>
<artifactId>google-genai</artifactId>
<version>0.8.0</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
