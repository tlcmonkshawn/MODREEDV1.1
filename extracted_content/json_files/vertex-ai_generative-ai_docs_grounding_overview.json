If you provide models with access to specific data\nsources, then grounding tethers their output to these data and reduces the\nchances of inventing content. This is particularly important in situations where\naccuracy and reliability are significant.\nGrounding provides the following benefits:\nReduces model hallucinations, which are instances where the model generates\ncontent that isn't factual.\nAnchors model responses to your data sources.\nProvides auditability by\nproviding grounding support, which are links to sources.\nYou can ground supported-model output in Vertex AI in the following ways:\nGrounding type\nDescription\nGrounding with Google Search\nConnect your model to world knowledge and a wide possible range of topics using Google Search.\nGrounding with Google Maps\nUse Google Maps data with your model to provide more accurate and context-aware responses to your prompts, including geospatial context.\nGrounding with Vertex AI Search\nUse retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to connect your model to your website data or your sets of documents stored in Vertex AI Search.\nGrounding with Elasticsearch\nUse retrieval-augmented generation with your existing Elasticsearch indexes and Gemini.\nGrounding with your search API\nConnect Gemini to your external data sources by grounding with any search API.\nWeb Grounding for Enterprise\nUse a web index suitable for highly-regulated industries to generate grounded responses with compliance controls.\nFor language support, see\nSupported languages for prompts\n.\nWhat's next\nTo learn more about responsible AI best practices and Vertex AI's\nsafety filters, see\nResponsible AI\n.\nSend feedback\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n, and code samples are licensed under the\nApache 2.0 License\n.
