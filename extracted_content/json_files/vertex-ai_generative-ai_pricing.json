A \"turn\" is one user input and the model's response.\nWhen audio to text transcription is enabled, all text tokens generated for transcription are charged at the text token output rate.\nVertex AI Model Optimizer Pricing  (Experimental)*\nVertex AI Model Optimizer simplifies use of Gemini for enterprise customers by providing a single meta-endpoint for Gemini model requests--customers using this service do not have to specify whether to use Flash, Pro, or a specific version. Instead they simply provide a configurable setting (cost, quality, or balance) to indicate their preferences, and Model Optimizer applies the right level of intelligence appropriate for the task by sending each query to the best fit model.\nVertex AI Model Optimizer applies dynamic pricing. This means that the average price per token is dependent on the model intelligence level applied to complete the task. For this reason, pricing examples are provided below to illustrate likely scenarios based on your configuration setting (see tables below). Model Optimizer SKUs are $1 skus that function as a purchasing unit to apply for your billing, you are still billed on a consumption basis after you have used the models.\n5:1 I/O ratio\nExample 1\nchat bot\nNOTE: these ranges are not guarantees, individual customer results may vary\nCustomer Preference\nCustomer Input Tokens Sent to MO\nCustomer Output Tokens Sent to MO\nAverage Input Price per Million Tokens (High Range)\nAverage Output Price per Million Tokens (High Range)\nAverage Input Price per Million Tokens (Low Range)\nAverage Output Price per Million Tokens (Low Range)\nCost\n10,000,000\n2,000,000\n$0.63\n$2.50\n$0.16\n$0.63\nBalanced\n10,000,000\n2,000,000\n$1.26\n$5.00\n$0.63\n$2.50\nQuality\n10,000,000\n2,000,000\n$1.89\n$7.50\n$1.26\n$5.00\n1:20  I/O ratio\nExample 2 Content generation\nCustomer Preference\nCustomer Input Tokens Sent to MO\nCustomer Output Tokens Sent to MO\nAverage Input Price per Million Tokens (High Range)\nAverage Output Price per Million Tokens (High Range)\nAverage Input Price per Million Tokens (Low Range)\nAverage Output Price per Million Tokens (Low Range)\nCost\n1,000,000\n20,000,000\n$0.63\n$2.50\n$0.16\n$0.63\nBalanced\n1,000,000\n20,000,000\n$1.26\n$5.00\n$0.63\n$2.50\nQuality\n1,000,000\n20,000,000\n$1.89\n$7.50\n$1.26\n$5.00\n* Model Optimizer is a paid experimental offering, and may route requests to experimental versions of Gemini on Vertex.\nOther Gemini models\nAll Gemini models other than Gemini 2.0 or Gemini 2.5 are billed based on modalities such as\ncharacters, images, video/audio seconds. Text input is charged by every 1,000\ncharacters of input (prompt) and every 1,000 characters of output (response).\nCharacters are counted by UTF-8 code points and white space is excluded from the\ncount, resulting in approximately 4 characters per token. Prediction requests\nthat lead to filtered responses are charged for the input only. At the end of\neach billing cycle, fractions of one cent ($0.01) are rounded to one cent.

Learn more about how much throughput each GSU provides\nhere\nand use our online estimator\nhere\n.\nDuration\nPrice per GSU\nPer\n1 week commit\n$1,200\nWeek\n1 month commit\n$2,700\nMonth\n3 month commit\n$2,400\nMonth\n1 year commit\n$2,000\nMonth\nExample cost calculation\nA user needs to ensure they can support 10 queries per second (QPS) of a query with input of 1,000 text tokens and 500 audio tokens and receive an output of 300 text tokens using gemini-2.0-flash.\nUsing the throughput and burndown rate\ntable\n,\nfor gemini-2.0-flash we know an input text token's burndown rate is 1 token, an\ninput audio token's burndown rate is 7 tokens, and an output text token's burndown rate is 4 tokens.\nThe user's total input tokens is 1,000* (1 token per input text token) + 500* (7 tokens per input audio token) =  4,500 burndown adjusted input tokens. The user's total output tokens is 300* (4 tokens per output text token) = 1,200 burndown adjusted output tokens. Adding them together gives us 4,500 burndown adjusted input tokens + 1,200 burndown adjusted output tokens = 5,700 total tokens per query.\nMultiplying the total tokens per query by QPS gives us 5,700 total tokens per query * 10 QPS = 57,000 total tokens per second.\nDividing this by the total throughput per second per GSU gives us 57,000 total tokens per second ÷ 3,360 per-second throughput per GSU = 16.96 GSUs. The minimum GSU purchase increment for this model is 1, so the user would need 17 GSUs.\nIf the user wanted to sustain this throughput for 1 week, it would cost $1,200 * 17 GSUs = $20,400 per week. If they wanted to sustain this throughput for 1 month, it would cost $2,700 * 17 GSUs = $45,900 per month. If they wanted to sustain this throughput for 3 months, it would cost $2,400 * 17 GSUs = $40,800 per month. And finally, if they wanted to sustain this throughput for 1 year, it would cost $2,000 * 17 GSUs = $34,000 per month.\nModel Tuning\nModel tuning is an effective way to customize large models to your tasks. It's a key step to improve the model's quality and efficiency. Model tuning provides the following benefits:\nHigher quality for your specific tasks\nIncreased model robustness\nLower inference latency and cost due to shorter prompts\nTuning is charged per million training tokens. Training tokens are calculated by the total number of tokens in your training dataset, multiplied by your number of epochs. For model inference, Gemini tuned model endpoint has the same prediction price as the base model.\nModel\nType\nPrice (/1M training tokens)\nGemini 2.5 Pro\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$25\nGemini 2.5 Flash\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$5\nGemini 2.5 Flash Lite\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$1.5\nGemma 3 27B IT\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$6.83\nLlama 3.1 8B\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$0.67\nLlama 3.2 1B\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$0.28\nLlama 3.2 3B\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$0.61\nLlama 3.3 70B\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$6.72\nLlama 4 Scout 17B 16E\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$5.77\nQwen 3 32B\nSupervised fine-tuning\n$6.57\n* Training tokens are calculated by the total number of tokens in your training dataset, multiplied by your number of epochs.\n* A Gemini tuned model endpoint has the same prediction price as the base model.\nCompare pricing for partner models on Vertex AI\nPartner models are a curated list of generative AI models developed by\nGoogle partners.
