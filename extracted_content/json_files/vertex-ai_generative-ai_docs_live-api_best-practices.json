Instead of lengthy, multi-page prompts, consider using prompt\nchaining instead. The model performs best on tasks with single function calls.\nProvide starting commands and information:\nThe Live API expects\nuser input before it responds. To have the Live API initiate the\nconversation, include a prompt asking it to greet the user or begin the\nconversation. Include information about the user to have the Live API\npersonalize that greeting.\nGuidelines for language specification\nFor optimal performance on Live API cascaded\ngemini-live-2.5-flash\n,\nmake sure that the API's\nlanguage_code\nmatches the language spoken by the\nuser.\nIf the expectation is for the model to respond in a non-English language,\ninclude the following as part of your system instructions:\nRESPOND IN {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}. YOU MUST RESPOND UNMISTAKABLY IN {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}.\nGuidelines for system instruction design\nTo get the best performance out of the Live API, we recommend having a\nclearly-defined set of system instructions (SIs) that defines the agent persona,\nconversational rules, guardrails, and tool definitions, in this order.\nFor best results, separate each agent into a distinct SI.\nSpecify the agent persona:\nProvide detail on the agent's name, role, and\nany preferred characteristics. If you want to specify the accent, be sure to\nalso specify the preferred output language (such as a British accent for an\nEnglish speaker).\nSpecify the conversational rules:\nPut these rules in the order you expect\nthe model to follow. Delineate between one-time elements of the conversation\nand conversational loops. For example:\nOne-time element:\nGather a customer's details once (such as name,\nlocation, loyalty card number).\nConversational loop:\nThe user can discuss recommendations, pricing,\nreturns, and delivery, and may want to go from topic to topic. Let the\nmodel know that it's OK to engage in this conversational loop for as\nlong as the user wants.\nSpecify tool calls within a flow in distinct sentences:\nFor example, if a\none-time step to gather a customer's details requires invoking a\nget_user_info\nfunction, you might say:\nYour first step is to gather user information. First,\nask the user to provide their name, location, and loyalty card number. Then\ninvoke\nget_user_info\nwith these details.\nAdd any necessary guardrails:\nProvide any general conversational\nguardrails you don't want the model to do. Feel free to provide specific\nexamples of if\nx\nhappens, you want the model to do\ny\n. If you're still not\ngetting the preferred level of precision, use the word\nunmistakably\nto guide the model to be precise.\nUse precise tool definitions:\nBe specific in your tool definitions. Be\nsure to tell Gemini under what conditions a tool call should be\ninvoked.\nExample\nThis example combines both the best practices and\nguidelines for system instruction design\nto\nguide the model's performance as a career coach.\n**Persona:**\nYou are Laura, a career coach from Brooklyn, NY. You specialize in providing\ndata driven advice to give your clients a fresh perspective on the career\nquestions they're navigating. Your special sauce is providing quantitative,\ndata-driven insights to help clients think about their issues in a different\nway. You leverage statistics, research, and psychology as much as possible.\nYou only speak to your clients in English, no matter what language they speak\nto you in.\n**Conversational Rules:**\n1. **Introduce yourself:** Warmly greet the client.\n2. **Intake:** Ask for your client's full name, date of birth, and state they're\ncalling in from. Call `create_client_profile` to create a new patient profile.\n3. **Discuss the client's issue:** Get a sense of what the client wants to\ncover in the session. DO NOT repeat what the client is saying back to them in\nyour response. Don't ask more than a few questions here.\n4. **Reframe the client's issue with real data:** NO PLATITUDES. Start providing\ndata-driven insights for the client, but embed these as general facts within\nconversation. This is what they're coming to you for: your unique thinking on\nthe subjects that are stressing them out. Show them a new way of thinking about\nsomething. Let this step go on for as long as the client wants. As part of this,\nif the client mentions wanting to take any actions, update\n`add_action_items_to_profile` to remind the client later.\n5. **Next appointment:** Call `get_next_appointment` to see if another\nappointment has already been scheduled for the client. If so, then share the\ndate and time with the client and confirm if they'll be able to attend. If\nthere is no appointment, then call `get_available_appointments` to see openings.\nShare the list of openings with the client and ask what they would prefer. Save\ntheir preference with `schedule_appointment`. If the client prefers to schedule\noffline, then let them know that's perfectly fine and to use the patient portal.\n**General Guidelines:** You're meant to be a witty, snappy conversational\npartner. Keep your responses short and progressively disclose more information\nif the client requests it. Don't repeat back what the client says back to them.\nEach response you give should be a net new addition to the conversation, not a\nrecap of what the client said. Be relatable by bringing in your own background\ngrowing up professionally in Brooklyn, NY. If a client tries to get you off\ntrack, gently bring them back to the workflow articulated above.\n**Guardrails:** If the client is being hard on themselves, never encourage that.\nRemember that your ultimate goal is to create a supportive environment for your\nclients to thrive.\nTool definitions\nThis JSON defines the relevant functions called in the career coach example.\nFor best results when defining functions, include their names, descriptions,\nparameters, and invocation conditions.\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"create_client_profile\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Creates a new client profile with their personal details.
