For example, you can ask Gemini to only respond\nwhen prompted or when certain specific topics are discussed. To see\nProactive Audio in action, check out\na demonstration of the features\n.\nThis guide covers how Proactive Audio works, how to\nintegrate it into your application, and what tokens you are billed for. This\nguide doesn't cover the price list for Proactive Audio. For\nfull pricing details, see\nVertex AI pricing\n.\nThis guide assumes you are working either in Vertex AI Studio or are\nusing the Google Gen AI SDK for Python.\nSupported models\nYou can use Proactive Audio with the following models:\nModel version\nAvailability level\ngemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-09-2025\nPublic preview\ngemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio\nPublic preview; Discontinuation date: October 17, 2025\nUse Proactive Audio\nProactive Audio is not enabled by default in\ngemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-09-2025\n.\nTo use Proactive Audio, configure the\nproactivity\nfield in\nthe setup message and set\nproactive_audio\nto\ntrue\n:\nPython\nconfig\n=\nLiveConnectConfig\n(\nresponse_modalities\n=\n[\n\"AUDIO\"\n],\nproactivity\n=\nProactivityConfig\n(\nproactive_audio\n=\nTrue\n),\n)\nHave a conversation using Proactive Audio\nYou can initiate a conversation with Gemini using\nProactive Audio and define when Gemini can\nrespond, limiting its responses to relevant topics.\nFor example, the following is a sample of what a conversation with\nGemini about cooking might look like:\nPrompt: \"You are an AI assistant in Italian cooking; only chime in when the topic is about Italian cooking.\"\nSpeaker A: \"I really love cooking!\" (No response from Gemini.)\nSpeaker B: \"Oh yes, me too! My favorite is French cuisine.\" (No response from\nGemini.)\nSpeaker A: \"I really like Italian food; do you know how to make a pizza?\"\n(Italian cooking topic will trigger response from Gemini.)\nLive API: \"I'd be happy to help! Here's a recipe for a pizza.\"\nFeatures\nWhen using Proactive Audio, Gemini will respond with\nminimal latency after the user is done speaking. This reduces interruptions and\nhelps Gemini not lose context if an interruption happens.\nProactive Audio also helps Gemini avoid interruptions\nfrom background noise or external chatter, and prevents Gemini from\nresponding if external chatter is introduced during a conversation.\nIf the user needs to interrupt during a response from Gemini,\nProactive Audio makes it easier for Gemini to\nappropriately back-channel (meaning appropriate interruptions are handled),\nrather than if a user uses filler words such as\numm\nor\nuhh\n.\nGemini can co-listen to an audio file that's not the speaker's\nvoice and subsequently answer questions about that audio file later in the\nconversation.\nBilling\nWhile Gemini is listening to a conversation, input audio tokens will be\ncharged.\nFor output audio tokens, you're only charged when Gemini responds. If\nGemini does not respond or stays silent, there will be no charge to\nyour output audio tokens.\nFor more information, see\nVertex AI pricing\n.\nSend feedback\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n, and code samples are licensed under the\nApache 2.0 License\n.
